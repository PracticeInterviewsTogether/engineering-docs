We should probably move this all to Notion. I initially chose to do this in GitHub because I feel like Notion gets too messy. But doing this in `.md` files is reallu cumbersome.
We might be able to find a visual Markdown editing tool or a plugin for VSCode...but linking between pages will still be a pain. Any suggestions?
